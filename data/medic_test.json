Symptoms of copper deficiency include loss of color in the hair and skin (due to decreased synthesis of melanin), anemia, fatigue, kinky hair, low body temperature, breakdown of connective tissue, various cardiovascular problems, nervous system disorders, and reduced resistance to infection.\n\nZinc interferes with copper absorption. High intake of zinc supplements can lead to copper deficiency.\n\nMenkes' disease, also called kinky or steely hair syndrome, is a genetic defect in copper absorption characterized by stunted growth, abnormalities in cardiovascular and skeletal development, progressive cognitive decline, and premature death.\n\nSome researchers have shown that copper deficiency is associated with elevated cholesterol and triglycerides, and the development of atherosclerosis. Thus, copper deficiency may play a role in the risk of cardiovascular disease. Copper deficiency has also been associated with emphysema."

Vitamin B12 deficiency inhibits DNA synthesis, which affects the growth and repair of all cells. The symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency include:\n- Fatigue\n- Peripheral neuropathy\n- Tongue and mouth irregularities\n- Depression, confusion and memory loss (especially in the elderly)\n- Macrocytic anemia (abnormally enlarged red blood cells)\n- Poor blood clotting and easy bruising\n- Dermatitis and skin sensitivity\n- Loss of appetite\n- Nausea\n- Vomiting\n\nAnemia is the first symptom of vitamin B12 deficiency. Pernicious anemia results from either inadequate vitamin B12 intake or reduced gastric secretion of intrinsic factor, which inhibits absorption.\n\nThe elderly are most susceptible to vitamin B12 deficiency due to atrophy of gastric parietal cells causing inadequate production of intrinsic factor. Deficiencies in the elderly often cause varying degrees of neuropsychiatric symptoms such as moodiness, confusion, abnormal gait, memory loss, agitation, delusions, dizziness, dementia, and hallucinations.\n\nMeatless diets are deficient in vitamin B12. Strict vegetarians are urged to use a vitamin B12 supplement.\n\nNumerous drugs inhibit vitamin B12 absorption and, when taken chronically, can lead to nutrient depletion. These include oral contraceptives, potassium medications, histamine-2 blockers (Axid®, Pepcid®, Tagamet®, Zantac®), proton pump inhibitors (Prevacid®, Prilose™), and phenytoin (Dilantin®)."

                "potential_risks": "Marginal zinc deficiencies are thought to be quite common in the United States. Because of its extensive range of biological activities, zinc deficiency can cause a wide range of deficiency symptoms. The symptoms of zinc deficiency include acne; impaired sense of smell and taste; delayed wound healing; anorexia; decreased immunity; frequent infections; depression; photophobia; night blindness; problems with skin, hair, and nails; menstrual problems; joint pain; and involuntary cyclical movements of the eyeball (nystagmus).\n\nZinc deficiency conditions were first reported in the 1960s in growing children and adolescent males from Egypt, Iran, and Turkey. Diets low in animal protein and high in phytate-containing grains produced symptoms of dwarfism, hypogonadism, and failure to mature sexually.\n\nPregnant women have greater zinc needs. Deficiency can cause impaired fetal development, low birth weight infants, and birth defects. Stretch marks during pregnancy are also partially due to zinc deficiency.\n\nZinc deficiency can be caused by inadequate dietary intake due to foods grown on zinc-depleted soils. Food processing also removes zinc, so fast foods and processed foods are also zinc depleted. Protein and/or calorie-restricted diets can also lead to zinc deficiency.\n\n- Zinc depletion is frequently seen in the following medical conditions: alcoholism, macular degeneration, diabetes, malignant melanoma, liver and kidney diseases, malabsorption syndromes such as celiac sprue, and inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease."

These include the accumulation of lipid secondary to decreased utilization of long-chain fatty acids, reduction of muscle carnitine levels, and depletion of muscle fiber energy stores.

These enzymes are important to the bioenergetics of cardiac function. Diazoxide and propranolol significantly inhibited both enzymes. Metoprolol did not inhibit succinoxidase, and was one-fourth as active as propranolol for inhibition of NADH-oxidase. Hydrochlorothiazide, hydralazine, and clonidine also inhibited CoQ10-NADH-oxidase. Reserpine did not inhibit either CoQ10-enzyme, and methyldopa was a very weak inhibitor of succinoxidase. The authors conclude that some clinical side-effects of propranolol may be due, in part, to inhibition of CoQ10-enzymes.
