            "overview": "Calcium is the most abundant mineral in the human body, and the fifth most common substance behind carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen. Average healthy male bodies contain about 2.53 pounds of calcium while female bodies contain about 2 pounds. Approximately 99% of our calcium is present in the bones and teeth, which leaves only about 1% in cells and body fluids.\n\nAlthough only a small amount of calcium is in the blood, the body goes to great lengths to maintain blood-calcium levels within a relatively narrow range. Three regulatory mechanisms control blood-calcium. If levels drop too low intestinal calcium absorption increases, bones increase calcium release, and the kidneys reduce calcium excretion.\n\nPhosphorus displaces calcium. Ingesting large amounts of phosphorus-containing foods will cause increased urinary excretion of calcium, which can cause the body to leach calcium from the bones and thus contribute to osteoporosis. The main sources of dietary phosphorus are soft drinks and animal protein.\n\nIn bones and teeth, calcium exists primarily as hydroxyapatite, which is a calcium carbonate/calcium phosphate crystalline compound that provides rigidity and strength to these tissues.\n\nThere is some question about the appropriateness of cow's milk as a source of calcium. First, milk is a frequent cause of food allergies due to the ingestion of foreign (cow) proteins. Second, many people suffer digestive problems caused by lactose intolerance. Third, an enzyme from cow's milk, called xanthine oxidase, is capable of causing damage to arterial membranes, and antibodies to bovine xanthine oxidase have been found in the blood of individuals with atherosclerosis.",
            "biological_function_and_effect": "- Bones & teeth: Calcium's most important, documented function is in the development and maintenance of healthy bones and teeth. Need is greatest during periods of rapid growth including childhood, pregnancy and lactation.\n- Osteoporosis: Caicium supplements are only minimally effective when taken alone. In one study, a nutritional supplement containing a broad range of micronutrients increased bone density 2-3 times more effectively than calcium alone.\n- High blood pressure: Low levels of calcium are associated with high blood pressure, and many studies have shown that calcium supplementation provides hypertensive patients with a slight lowering of blood pressure. However, the gains are so small that calcium cannot be suggested as a treatment.\n- Cancer: Several studies report that men with low levels of calcium intake have higher rates of colorectal cancer. Calcium supplementation in high risk individuals also decreased the rate of abnormal cell division in the colon.\n- Muscle contraction: lonized serum calcium helps to initiate muscle contractions. As such, it plays a vital role in the contraction-relaxation cycle that regulates a normal heart beat.\n- Blood clotting: Calcium is involved in several steps of the blood clotting mechanism.\n- Cell wall permeability: lonized calcium regulates the passage of fluids across cellular membranes by affecting cell wall permeability.\n- Enzyme function: Calcium activates various enzyme systems responsible for muscle contraction, fat digestion, and protein metabolism.",

Folic acid needs are greater during pregnancy. Folic acid is one of the most common vitamin deficiencies. It is easily destroyed by heat, light, and oxygen. Substantial losses occur in cooking and storage. Symptoms of folic acid deficiency include megaloblastic anemia, birth defects, cervical dysplasia, elevated homocysteine, headache, fatigue, hair loss, anorexia, insomnia, diarrhea, nausea, and increased infections. Folic acid is necessary for the production of red blood cells (erythrocytes) which carry oxygen from the lungs to the tissues and carbon dioxide from tissues to the lungs. Folic acid deficiency results in anemia and reduced tissue oxygenation. This results in a condition known as megaloblastic anemia, which is a condition characterized by enlarged nucleated abnormal red blood cells. This condition can produce symptoms of tiredness, weakness, diarrhea, and weight loss. Folic acid helps regulate neural development and the transfer of genetic material to new cells. Numerous drugs have been shown to deplete folic acid. During pregnancy, the rapidly growing fetus substantially increases a woman's need for folic acid. Folic acid deficiency during pregnancy dramatically increases the risk of birth defects such as spina bifida and cleft palate. The link between folic acid deficiency and birth defects is so strong, the authors recommend that all women have their folic acid status checked before trying to become pregnant. If this practice were followed, thousands of birth defects would probably be prevented each year. A laboratory test called the Neutrophilic Hypersegmentation Index (NHI) has been developed that can identify the earliest stages of folate insufficiency.\n\nCervical dysplasia is a term that refers to the development of abnormal cells in the uterus. It is a precancerous condition that is usually discovered when a woman has her annual PAP exam. This condition may contribute to an increased number of hysterectomies. Over 800,000 women have hysterectomies every year in the United States. Some professionals believe that the folic acid depletion caused by oral contraceptives is linked to this high incidence of cervical dysplasia and hysterectomies. Elevated homocysteine is now recognized as one of the most critical independent risk factors to cardiovascular disease. Homocysteine is a toxic intermediate metabolite in the metabolism of the amino acid methionine. It is capable of directly damaging the vascular system and initiating the process of atherosclerosis. Folic acid is one of the nutrients that is required to metabolize homocysteine so that it does not build up in the blood and begin to damage the lining of the blood vessels.",
            "side_effects_and_toxicity": "Folic acid is essentially nontoxic, even at very high doses. Large doses of folic acid can mask an underlying vitamin B12 deficiency, which if gone undetected, could result in irreversible nerve damage. Consequently, folic acid is limited to 800 mcg in OTC nutritional supplements."

It was isolated in 1926 as a water-soluble, crystalline yellowish white powder with a salty, slightly nutty taste. In 1936, chemists accomplished the synthesis and determined its chemical formula.\n\nBeriberi is the classic deficiency syndrome, resulting from a vitamin B1 deficiency. It is more prevalent in Asian countries where polished rice is the staple diet. When beriberi occurs in the United States, it is most commonly seen in severely malnourished infants or elderly people. In adults, chronic dieting, alcoholism, and diets consisting primarily of highly processed, refined foods are causes of vitamin B1 deficiency.",

Required by every cell in the body to make ATP, which is the fuel and energy source for the body.\n- Nerve function: Necessary for the maintenance of nerve tissues, function, and transmission.\n- Blood sugar conversion: Plays a major role in the conversion of blood sugar (glucose) into biological energy.\n- Muscle function: Important in the maintenance of muscular function, especially the heart.\n- Fatty acid synthesis: Involved in fatty acid synthesis.\n- Thought and memory: Required for the synthesis of acetylcholine, which is the primary neurotransmitter involved in thought and memory processes.",

Deficiencies seldom occur alone, but rather as a component of multiple-nutrient deficiencies. Vitamin B2 deficiency symptoms include:\n- Cheilosis (cracks in the corners of the mouth); mucous membranes become inflamed; soreness & burning of the lips, mouth, and tongue (possible magenta-colored tongue).\n- Reddening, tearing, burning, and itching of the eyes; eyes that tire easily and eyes that are very sensitive to light.\n- Dry, itchy, scaly skin (seborrheic dermatitis) and scaling eczema of the face and genitals may develop. In severe long-term deficiency, damage to nerve tissue that can cause depression and hysteria.\n\nRiboflavin is heat stable, but very sensitive to destruction by light. Because it is water-soluble, substantial amounts are lost by leaching into water when cooking. Since the vitamin exists in the germ and bran of grains, milling and processing of grains results in substantial losses.\n\nIndividuals at greatest risk for riboflavin deficiency include alcoholics, and infants and/or elderly persons on unbalanced, nutritionally deficient diets. A U.S. Department of Agriculture survey estimated that 34% of Americans get less than the RDA of vitamin B2 daily. Oral contraceptives increase the need for vitamin B2. Thorazine® and tricyclic antidepressants such as Elavil® and Tofranil® inhibit the absorption of riboflavin and can cause nutrient depletions.",

Vitamin B12 is an essential growth factor and plays a vital role in the metabolism of all cells, especially those of the gastrointestinal tract, bone marrow, and nervous tissue.\n\nSeveral different cobalamin compounds exhibit vitamin B12 activity. Cyanocobalamin, the most stable and most active form of the vitamin, contains a cyanide group, which is well below toxic levels and totally safe.\n\nVitamin B12 is a water-soluble, red crystalline substance. Its red color is due to the presence of cobalt in the molecule. A protein in gastric secretions called intrinsic factor binds to vitamin B12 and facilitates its absorption. Without intrinsic factor, <1% of vitamin B12 is absorbed.\n\nRelatively large amounts of vitamin B12 are stored in the liver.",

This means B12 plays a central role in the replication of the genetic code, and makes it a critical growth factor in all cells of the body.\n- DNA synthesis: Vitamin B12 demethylates methylfolate and helps generate tetrahydrofolate in the synthesis of DNA.\n- Nervous system: Vitamin B12 is required for the synthesis of myelin, the insulation around nerves. Hence it plays a major role in the functioning and maintenance of the nervous system.\n- Synthesis and metabolism: Vitamin B12 transfers methyl groups in the synthesis of methionine and in folic acid metabolism.

Pernicious anemia results from either inadequate vitamin B12 intake or reduced gastric secretion of intrinsic factor, which inhibits absorption.\n\nThe elderly are most susceptible to vitamin B12 deficiency due to atrophy of gastric parietal cells causing inadequate production of intrinsic factor. Deficiencies in the elderly often cause varying degrees of neuropsychiatric symptoms such as moodiness, confusion, abnormal gait, memory loss, agitation, delusions, dizziness, dementia, and hallucinations.\n\nMeatless diets are deficient in vitamin B12. Strict vegetarians are urged to use a vitamin B12 supplement.\n\nNumerous drugs inhibit vitamin B12 absorption and, when taken chronically, can lead to nutrient depletion. These include oral contraceptives, potassium medications, histamine-2 blockers (Axid®, Pepcid®, Tagamet®, Zantac®), proton pump inhibitors (Prevacid®, Prilose™), and phenytoin (Dilantin®).",

            "synonyms": [
                "Ascorbic Acid"
            ],
            "overview": "Vitamin C is the vitamin that cures the world's oldest known nutritional deficiency disease, scurvy. In fact, the term \"ascorbic\" is derived from Latin (a = not, scorbutus = scurvy, meaning without scurvy). It was first isolated by Albert Szent-Györgyi in 1928 from pork adrenal glands and called hexuronic acid. In 1933, its correct structural formula was established, it was successfully synthesized, and the name was changed to ascorbic acid.\n\nVitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin that is easily absorbed from the small intestine. It is concentrated in many tissues throughout the body, but the adrenal glands contain the highest concentration.\n\nHumans are one of the few species who cannot manufacture vitamin C and must depend on our diet, or nutritional supplements, as the primary source. Vitamin C exists in nature in both its reduced form, L-ascorbic acid, and in its oxidized form, L-dehydroascorbic acid. L-ascorbic acid is the most active form. However, they convert back and forth to each other in a reversible equilibrium, and both are antiscorbutic.",
            "biological_function_and_effect": "Vitamin C participates in oxidation-reduction reactions, energy production, tyrosine metabolism, reduction and storage of iron, and the activation of folic acid. It is essential in the formation or synthesis of collagen, serotonin, norepinephrine, thyroxine, and some of the corticosteroids.\n\nIn his 1972 book, The Healing Factor: Vitamin C Against Disease, Irwin Stone, MD, discussed over 500 studies which reported the value of high doses of vitamin C in preventing and treating about 100 diseases. Research since then has continued to support the incredible importance of this nutrient.\n\nVitamin C plays a major role in the synthesis of collagen and elastin, the major structural components of skin, tendons, bone matrix, tooth dentin, blood vessels, and connective tissues between cells. Collectively, collagen is the most abundant protein in the body, comprising 25% to 30% of total body protein.\n\n- Stress: Vitamin C helps the body handle all types of stress. It is required for the synthesis of the body's main stress response hormones in the adrenal glands, including adrenaline, noradrenaline, cortisol, and histamine. Stresses, such as fever, burns, exposure to cold, physical trauma, fractures, high altitude, and radiation all require larger doses of vitamin C.\n- Antioxidant: Vitamin C's ability to donate hydrogen atoms from its two hydroxyl (OH) positions to neutralize free radicals makes it one of the body's most powerful and important antioxidants. Being water-soluble, it provides protection in all body fluids, within every cell in the body, and is highly concentrated in the brain to protect against brain aging.\n- Cancer: Vitamin C prevents formation of nitrosamines, and dramatically reduces cervical dysplasia. Plasma levels of vitamin C are inversely correlated with the incidence of GI and cervical cancers. Vitamin C may prevent the formation of bladder tumors, inhibit hyaluronidase (an enzyme found in malignant tumors), slow down degradation of cellular tissue and decrease invasion of cancerous growth, stimulate production of phagocytic leukocytes which engulf and destroy cancer cells, and prevent free radical damage.\n- Cardiovascular: Vitamin C has cardiovascular functions and include the following:\n- increases HDL\n- decreases elevated LDL and total cholesterol by conversion to bile acids for excretion\n- is necessary for synthesis of collagen and elastin which maintains strength and elasticity of blood vessels\n- decreases free radical oxidation of cholesterol\n- decreases levels of lipoprotein(a) or Lp(a) which is now known to form atherosclerotic plaques\n- Atherosclerotic plaques: Vitamin C also helps to dissolve atherosclerotic plaques. Calcium/phospholipid/cholesterol plaque (insoluble) reacts with sodium ascorbate to form sodium/phospholipid/cholesterol (soluble) and calcium ascorbate (soluble).\n- Immunity: Vitamin C also helps to boost the immune system by:\n- increasing the production of disease-fighting white blood cells (neutrophils, lymphocytes, and natural killer cells)\n- increasing levels of antibodies IgA, IgG, and IgM which fight infections\n- increasing body's production of interferon\n- modulating prostaglandin synthesis\n- Asthma: Vitamin C functions as both a very mild antihistamine (it inhibits the release and enhances the degradation of histamine) and as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor (the same action as some asthma medications). Vitamin C reduces the frequency and intensity of bronchial spasms in asthmatics.\n- Antiviral: Ascorbic acid may have some antiviral actions against most viruses (if enough is used) including herpes, shingles, viral hepatitis, polio, etc, by stimulating the production of interferons which are the proteins that protect cells against viral attack.\n- Wound healing: Increases the healing of scars, broken bones, burns, etc.\n- Common cold: Vitamin C probably reduces the severity of symptoms associated with, and duration of, the common cold.\n- Detoxification: Vitamin C detoxifies heavy metal toxins such as mercury, lead, cadmium, and nickel.\n- Regeneration: Vitamin C is capable of regenerating the antioxidant form of vitamin E",

            "overview": "Vitamin D was isolated in 1930 and named calciferol. Since then, more metabolites have been found, and the two major forms of this vitamin are now known to be vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) and vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol). Vitamin D is actually a hormone precursor, which can be manufactured by the body. Therefore, in a classical sense, it is not actually an essential nutrient. However, since the disease rickets is related to vitamin D deficiency, it has been traditionally classified as a vitamin.\n\nVitamin D is known as the \"sunshine\" vitamin. It is formed in the body by the action of the sun's ultraviolet rays on the skin, converting the biological precursor 7-dehydroergosterol (found in animals and humans) into vitamin D3. Ultraviolet radiation converts the biological precursor ergosterol (found in plants) to vitamin D2. Vitamin D is a fat-soluble nutrient that is stored in body fats, principally the liver.",
            "biological_function_and_effect": "- Bones and teeth: Vitamin D promotes the absorption of calcium and phosphorus for the growth of bones and teeth. For this reason, it is a very important growth nutrient for infants and children.\n- Calcitriol: Vitamin D3 is converted in the liver to 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25-HCC) which is 5 times more active than vitamin D3. 25-HCC is then converted in the kidneys to 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25-HCC) which is ten times more potent than vitamin D3. The active 1,25-HCC form of vitamin D is also called calcitriol. Since calcitriol is produced in the kidney and functions elsewhere in the body, it is considered a hormone, with the intestines and bone as its targets. It is the most active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, that acts in the intestines to promote absorption of calcium and phosphorus.\n- Bones: Vitamin D is involved in both the formation (mineralization) of bone, as well as in the mobilization (demineralization) of bone mineral.\n- Cancer: There is some indication that vitamin D might be helpful in some cancers. Geographic areas with the least amount of sunlight have the highest rates of colorectal and breast cancer. The active form of vitamin D, calcitriol, has some inhibitory activity against human melanoma, leukemia, breast, lymphoma, and colon cancer cells.\n- Regulation: Active vitamin D (calcitriol) regulates serum levels of calcium and phosphorus.\n- Osteoporosis: Vitamin D may help to prevent osteoporosis since it facilitates the absorption of calcium from the intestines. Low calcium levels stimulate the parathyroid gland which initiates pulling calcium out of the bone.\n- Psoriasis: Sunlight and ultraviolet light are often helpful for individuals with psoriasis. This suggests the active form of vitamin D may also offer some support for these people.\n- Immunity: The active form of vitamin D enhances the immune system by stimulating the activity of macrophages.",

They referred to it as the antisterility vitamin, which turned out to be an unfortunate designation since it was subsequently found to not have this activity in humans. The same researchers isolated the pure substance from wheat germ oil in 1936 and elucidated the structure in 1938, giving it the chemical name of tocopherol (after the Greek words \"tokos\", meaning offspring, and \"phero\", meaning to bring forth).\n\nVitamin E is actually a group of eight compounds including four tocopherols (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta) and four additional tocotrienol derivatives. Alpha tocopherol is the most common and most potent form and is what is usually meant by the term vitamin E. Pure vitamin E compounds are easily oxidized, so they are manufactured as acetate or succinate esters.\n\nNatural vitamin E is d-alpha tocopherol, whereas synthetically produced vitamin E is a mixture consisting of both the d- and I-isomers as di-alpha tocopherol. Different studies report that natural vitamin E has from 34% to 50% greater bioavailability than synthetic vitamin E.",

This may be due to Vitamin E's ability to protect tissues against free radical damage and support the immune system.\n- Exercise: During heavy exercise, vitamin E markedly reduces the amount of exercise-induced free radical damage to the blood and tissues, and also decreases the incidence of exercise-induced muscle injury.\n- Eyes: Vitamin E protects the eyes against cataracts and macular degeneration through its antioxidant actions.\n- PMS: Some studies have shown that vitamin E supplementation helps many women alleviate the symptoms of PMS, again through its antioxidant properties.",

The symptoms of zinc deficiency include acne; impaired sense of smell and taste; delayed wound healing; anorexia; decreased immunity; frequent infections; depression; photophobia; night blindness; problems with skin, hair, and nails; menstrual problems; joint pain; and involuntary cyclical movements of the eyeball (nystagmus).\n\nZinc deficiency conditions were first reported in the 1960s in growing children and adolescent males from Egypt, Iran, and Turkey. Diets low in animal protein and high in phytate-containing grains produced symptoms of dwarfism, hypogonadism, and failure to mature sexually.\n\nPregnant women have greater zinc needs. Deficiency can cause impaired fetal development, low birth weight infants, and birth defects. Stretch marks during pregnancy are also partially due to zinc deficiency.\n\nZinc deficiency can be caused by inadequate dietary intake due to foods grown on zinc-depleted soils. Food processing also removes zinc, so fast foods and processed foods are also zinc depleted. Protein and/or calorie-restricted diets can also lead to zinc deficiency.\n\n- Zinc depletion is frequently seen in the following medical conditions: alcoholism, macular degeneration, diabetes, malignant melanoma, liver and kidney diseases, malabsorption syndromes such as celiac sprue, and inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease.",

There are ten coenzyme @ compounds that occur throughout nature, but only coenzyme Q10 is synthesized in humans. In 1958, Professor Karl Folkers elucidated the chemical structure of coenzyme Q10 while working at Merck, Inc. Working with minute quantities, Folkers was able to determine that CoQ10 had great promise in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. However, Professor Folkers was not able to convince his superiors to pursue the development of CoQ10 because Merck had recently launched their new blockbuster drug in the cardiovascular arena called Diurl®. Consequently, the formula and patent rights for coenzyme Q10 were sold to a Japanese company. The Japanese quickly developed new methods of synthesizing large quantities, and coenzyme Q10 has become the best selling natural product for cardiovascular disease in Japan. The story of the miracle nutrient, coenzyme Q10, is just beginning to be recognized in the United States.",

Because it is fat-soluble, it is able to reside in the mitochondrial cell membranes where it provides protection against free radical damage.\n- Cardiovascular disease: CoQ10 is reportedly useful in all kinds of cardiovascular disease. CoQ10 has been found to be effective for periodontal disease.\n- Protective: Coenzyme Q10 also helps to protect against the toxic side effects of drugs such as Adriamycin®, beta-blockers, and drugs used for psychiatric disorders.",

            "effects_of_depletion": "Although we get a limited amount of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) from dietary sources, the majority of CoQ10 in humans is manufactured by our own cells. The biosynthesis of coenzyme Q10 is a 17-step process that requires the following nutrients: riboflavin (132), niacinamide (133), pantothenic acid (B5), pyridoxine (136), cobalamin (B12), folic acid, vitamin C, and numerous other trace elements. Consequently, there are many ways the complex synthesis of coenzyme Q10 can be interrupted. It is probable that many people with health problems are suffering from a coenzyme Q10 deficiency due to inadequate dietary intake of the necessary nutrients and/or ingestion of one or more drugs that interrupt the synthesis of coenzyme Q10. Symptoms of coenzyme Q10 deficiency include congestive heart failure, high blood pressure, angina, mitral valve prolapse, stroke, cardiac arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, lack of energy, gingivitis, and generalized weakening of the immune system. Since coenzyme Q10 is intimately involved in the production of energy, a deficiency of CoQ10 first affects the heart and cardiovascular system because the heart is the most energy demanding muscle in the human body. The results of some studies suggest that congestive heart failure is primarily a coenzyme Q10 deficiency disease.",
